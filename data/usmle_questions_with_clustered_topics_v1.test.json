He has alcoholism and opiate, cocaine, and amphetamine use disorder, but he has abstained from alcohol and illicit substances during the past 2 weeks. He also has alcoholic cirrhosis. His only medication is a daily multivitamin. He previously drank six 12-oz beers daily. He appears chronically ill and is somnolent. Temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Examination shows conjunctival icterus, ascites, and 2+ edema of the lower extremities. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is 4/5 throughout. When he is awake, there is a postural and action tremor of the forearms and hands that is accompanied by a sudden, brief loss of muscle strength. His speech is normal, and he is able to follow simple commands. Serum total bilirubin concentration is 3 mg/dL. Blood and urine cultures grow no pathogens. Which of the following is most likely to improve this patient\u2019s cognition and movement disorder?\n(A) Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime therapy\n(B) Intravenous vitamin B1 (thiamine) therapy\n(C) Oral lactulose therapy\n(D) Oral lorazepam therapy",

She says she would take a nap if she could, but she picks her children up as soon as she leaves work and spends the evening doing homework with them, making their dinner, and preparing lunches for the following day. By 9 PM, the children are in bed so she eats her own dinner and does some housework. She says that after 9 PM is when she smokes most of her cigarettes. She has not had depressed mood, excessive worry, or change in weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows dark circles under the eyes and injected conjunctivae.

Passive rewarming is helpful for mild hypothermia, but frostbite requires rapid controlled rewarming of the affected part to minimize tissue loss (again, provided refreezing will not occur).",
                "Rubbing/massaging the feet or applying snow/ice": "Not appropriate. Mechanical trauma to frozen tissue worsens cellular injury and can precipitate skin breakdown and necrosis.",
                "Direct dry heat (eg, heating pad, radiator, fire) to rewarm feet": "Not appropriate. Frostbitten tissue has decreased sensation and is prone to thermal burns; dry heat is less controlled than a warm-water bath.",
                "Immediate debridement or amputation": "Not appropriate initially. Definitive surgical decisions are typically delayed until tissue demarcation occurs (often weeks) unless there is wet gangrene, infection/sepsis, or compartment syndrome. Early surgery risks unnecessary loss of viable tissue.",
                "Thrombolysis (eg, tPA) or vasodilator therapy (eg, iloprost) as the immediate next step": "Not appropriate as the first step. These are considered for severe frostbite (eg, suspected deep injury) after rewarming and reassessment of perfusion (often with absent Doppler pulses or angiographic evidence) and typically within specific time windows. Rewarming comes first.",
                "Letting the feet thaw if there is a possibility of refreezing": "Not appropriate. If refreezing risk is present, thawing should be delayed because freeze\u2013thaw\u2013refreeze cycles markedly worsen tissue loss. In this ED scenario, refreezing risk is low, making rapid rewarming appropriate."

The enzyme defect decreases cortisol (\u00b1 aldosterone) synthesis, increasing ACTH and adrenal steroid precursors that are shunted into androgen production. This causes prenatal androgen excess and virilization of external genitalia in genetic females, while internal female reproductive organs are typically present (no MIS). Severe forms can present with salt-wasting (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, dehydration) in the neonatal period."

Other common answer choices are less likely because: (1) naltrexone (opioid receptor antagonist), acamprosate (modulates glutamatergic/NMDA), and disulfiram (aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition) are used for maintenance treatment of alcohol use disorder/relapse prevention rather than acute withdrawal; (2) antipsychotics (D2 antagonists) can worsen seizure threshold and do not treat the underlying withdrawal physiology; (3) beta-blockers/clonidine may reduce autonomic symptoms but do not prevent seizures or delirium tremens; (4) barbiturates also enhance GABA-A but are not first-line due to narrower therapeutic index and higher respiratory depression risk (reserved for refractory cases)."

This is a type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction; injury (often after triggers such as respiratory infections, smoking, or hydrocarbon exposure) is thought to expose/alter basement membrane epitopes, leading to IgG autoantibody formation and characteristic linear IgG deposition on immunofluorescence."

The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out\nof her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since\nthe symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was\nadopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170\ncm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m\u00b2. Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min,\nrespirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination\ndiscloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the\nupper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase\nconcentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within\nthe reference ranges. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

Differential diagnosis for abnormal uterine bleeding in a 46-year-old includes structural causes (leiomyoma, endometrial polyp, adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma) and nonstructural causes (anovulatory/perimenopausal AUB, coagulopathy, thyroid disease, medications). Although the exam strongly suggests leiomyomas (irregularly shaped, enlarged, mobile uterus) and this is the most likely diagnosis, the appropriate next step in evaluation for abnormal uterine bleeding in patients age \u226545 is endometrial sampling (endometrial biopsy) to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy; transvaginal ultrasound is also used to confirm/characterize fibroids and assess the endometrium."

The stroke had resulted in right-sided hemiparesis and difficulties with speech and swallowing. Medical history is also significant for hypertension. The patient has been hospitalized twice during the past 3 months for pneumonias that did not respond to oral antibiotic therapy in the nursing facility.

Physical examination discloses jugular venous distention, 8 cm at 45 degrees. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Auscultation of the heart discloses regular tachycardia with no gallops. There is fullness and tenderness to palpation of the low central abdomen but no rebound or guarding. Examination of the extremities shows 1+ pedal edema bilaterally.

Differential diagnosis includes milk residue (more likely if lesions wipe/scrape off easily), oral candidiasis (more likely when plaques are adherent and recur), and far less likely entities in this age group such as leukoplakia/EBV-related oral hairy leukoplakia (typically in immunocompromised patients) or herpetic stomatitis (vesicles/ulcers). Appropriate pharmacotherapy for suspected neonatal thrush is nystatin oral suspension applied to oral mucosa (and treatment of the breastfeeding parent\u2019s nipples with topical azole if breastfeeding to prevent reinfection); oral fluconazole is used for refractory or severe cases."

He says he has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue but has not had any other noticeable bleeding. He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever, chills, or rectal drainage. He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350/mm\u00b3; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive.
