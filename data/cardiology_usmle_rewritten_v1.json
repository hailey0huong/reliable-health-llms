He had been well until 1 week ago, when he developed rhinorrhea, cough, and a sore throat. These symptoms resolved spontaneously 2 days ago. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. On arrival, he is pale and in moderate respiratory distress. Pulse is 120/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. On pulmonary examination, crackles are heard throughout the lung fields. On cardiac examination, a gallop is heard. S1 is soft. A grade 2/6, high-pitched holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n(A) Glomerulonephritis\n(B) Myocarditis\n(C) Pneumonia\n(D) Rheumatic fever\n(E) Systemic lupus erythematosus",

The pain was located behind her sternum and radiated to her left jaw and shoulder. She also had shortness of breath, palpitations, and nausea. Initial ECG obtained on admission showed ST-segment depressions in leads V\u2083 through V\u2086. Nitroglycerin was administered, and the chest pain resolved. Follow-up serial ECGs disclosed no abnormalities and serum troponin concentrations were within the reference ranges. Cardiac catheterization obtained the next morning showed no substantial narrowing of the coronary arteries. At discharge, the patient declined medication to prevent recurrence of pain. The patient reports that since discharge, she has had two episodes of chest discomfort lasting 2 to 4 minutes, similar in location and quality to the pain precipitating her hospitalization. Medical history otherwise is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities.

The pain was located behind her sternum and radiated to her left jaw and shoulder. She also had shortness of breath, palpitations, and nausea. Initial ECG obtained on admission showed ST-segment depressions in leads V\u2083 through V\u2086. Nitroglycerin was administered, and the chest pain resolved. Follow-up serial ECGs disclosed no abnormalities and serum troponin concentrations were within the reference ranges. Cardiac catheterization obtained the next morning showed no substantial narrowing of the coronary arteries. At discharge, the patient declined medication to prevent recurrence of pain. The patient reports that since discharge, she has had two episodes of chest discomfort lasting 2 to 4 minutes, similar in location and quality to the pain precipitating her hospitalization. Medical history otherwise is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities.

Initial ECG obtained on admission showed ST-segment depressions in leads V\u2083 through V\u2086. Nitroglycerin was administered, and the chest pain resolved. Follow-up serial ECGs disclosed no abnormalities and serum troponin concentrations were within the reference ranges. Cardiac catheterization obtained the next morning showed no substantial narrowing of the coronary arteries. At discharge, the patient declined medication to prevent recurrence of pain. The patient reports that since discharge, she has had two episodes of chest discomfort lasting 2 to 4 minutes, similar in location and quality to the pain precipitating her hospitalization. Medical history otherwise is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prescribe at this time? Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prescribe at this time and why not the other choices?",

She also reports fatigue, a feeling of heaviness in her chest with exertion, trouble sleeping, and the very\nrecent onset of a rapid heart beat and fluttering in her chest. She says, \"I was always sick as a child.\" She does not smoke\ncigarettes, and she is not currently taking any medications other than occasional aspirin. Her father died of a myocardial\ninfarction at age 55 years. She is married and has two teenaged children. She did have some shortness of breath at the end of\nher second pregnancy. Physical examination today shows a thin woman with an irregular pulse of 130/min. Thyroid gland is\nnormal to palpation. There is a prominent diastolic rumble heard best over the apical area of her heart. Lungs are clear; there\nis no hepatomegaly or pretibial edema. Which of the following is the most helpful diagnostic study at this time?\n(A) Chest x-ray\n(B) ECG\n(C) Serum anti-streptolysin O titer\n(D) Serum C-reactive protein concentration\n(E) Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration",

Hemoptysis (item\u202f3) and pulmonary crackles (item\u202f8) are classic complications of severe mitral stenosis. Other options lack these key findings: ASD with pulmonary hypertension would produce a systolic ejection murmur and fixed split S2, not a diastolic rumble; chronic mitral regurgitation yields a holosystolic murmur, not diastolic; coarctation presents with upper\u2011extremity hypertension; congenital aortic stenosis produces a systolic ejection murmur. Hence, (E) is the most likely diagnosis."

No significant interactions with hydrochlorthiazide, furosemide, losartan orlisinopril. No significant interactions with digoxin, warfarin or simvastatin. Drugs that inhibit CYP2C9 can increase plasma levels of Essepro. Patients on Essepro who are also treated with drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme shhould be monitored closely, and dosage of Essepro may need to be adjusted based on blood pressure response.\nImportant Safety Information\nPatients treated with Essepro should be advised against sudden discontinuation of therapy. When discontinuing therapy, dosage should be gradually tapered over 2 weeks. Essepro is contraindicated i patients with bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, severe hepatic impairment, and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Essepro should be used with caution in patients with peripheral vascular disease, renal impairment or thyrotoxicoses. Caution should be used in diabetics, as beta blockers may mask some manifestations of hypoglycemia. In general, patients with bronchospastic disease should not receive beta blockers.\nA 65-year-old woman comes to the office for blood pressure medication management. Medical history is significant for poorly\ncontrolled hypertension, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis previously treated with methotrexate.

Drugs that inhibit CYP2C9 can increase plasma levels of Essepro. Patients on Essepro who are also treated with drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme shhould be monitored closely, and dosage of Essepro may need to be adjusted based on blood pressure response.\nImportant Safety Information\nPatients treated with Essepro should be advised against sudden discontinuation of therapy. When discontinuing therapy, dosage should be gradually tapered over 2 weeks. Essepro is contraindicated i patients with bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, severe hepatic impairment, and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.

Pericardiocentesis 9 weeks ago\nshowed a serosanguineous effusion; culture of the effusion was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and therapy with\nisoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol was initiated. During the past 2 weeks, he has had increasing shortness of breath on\nminimal exertion, cough, pain in the right upper quadrant, and swelling of the lower extremities. BMI is 26 kg/m\u00b2. Vital signs\ntoday are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 105/65 mm Hg. Physical\nexamination discloses 10 cm of jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiac\nexamination discloses distant but normal heart sounds. The liver is tender and is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin.\nThere is 2+ to 3+ pitting edema from the knees distally. HIV antibody test is negative. ECG shows nonspecific ST-T\nchanges. Chest x-ray today is unchanged from the x-ray obtained at the time of diagnosis, which showed resolution of apical\nand perihilar infiltrates and a normal-sized heart. Which of these options will you do next in managing this case? Explain why the other options are incorrect.",

Supporting factors include obesity (item\u202f2, weight\u202f8) which worsens hypertension and increases cardiovascular risk. While dyslipidemia and impaired glucose are present (items\u202f6 and\u202f7), the primary therapeutic target per current guidelines is blood pressure control.

Cocaine\u2011induced chest pain is mediated by catecholamine excess; an alpha\u2011adrenergic blocker such as phentolamine directly counteracts this vasospasm and hypertension. Beta\u2011blockers (items\u202f1,\u202f3) are contraindicated because unopposed alpha stimulation can worsen vasospasm, and fibrinolysis (choice\u202fE) is unnecessary without evidence of infarction. Therefore, phentolamine is the appropriate additional pharmacotherapy."

He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m\u00b2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour.

The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m\u00b2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Explain your rationale on each choice.\n\n(A) Decrease the dose of metoprolol\n(B) Increase the dose of prednisone\n(C) Obtain serum vitamin D concentration\n(D) Order a transthoracic echocardiography",

The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m\u00b2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Explain your rationale on each choice.",
