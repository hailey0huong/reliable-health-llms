She takes no medications on a regular basis but during\nthe past 3 days she has been taking an over-the-counter oral cold medication. She follows a strict low-fat vegetarian diet and\nshe drinks three to four glasses of wine per week. She jogs 3 miles a day when she is not sick. Vital signs today are\ntemperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, and blood pressure 140/94 mm Hg. Height is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in); weight is\n54 kg (120 lb); BMI is 19 kg/m\u00b2. On physical examination she appears slightly anxious. Nasal mucosa is erythematous and\nswollen, and sinuses are nontender. Posterior pharynx is also erythematous but there are no exudates. Lungs are clear on\nauscultation and cardiac examination is normal. Repeat blood pressure measurement at the end of the examination is\n142/96 mm Hg in the left arm and 138/94 mm Hg in the right arm.

Key evaluation is transthoracic echocardiography to confirm diagnosis and grade severity (valve area/mean gradient/jet velocity) and to assess LV function. Management depends on severity: mild\u2013moderate disease is monitored with periodic echocardiography and risk-factor control; severe symptomatic disease is treated with aortic valve replacement (TAVR/SAVR) and cardiology referral."
